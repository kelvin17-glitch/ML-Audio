Month 1: Audio Foundations, Librosa Mastery & Feature Engineering

Week 1: Audio Fundamentals & Librosa Basics

Day 1-2: Digital Audio Theory & Setup

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Concepts: Sound waves (frequency, amplitude, phase), Analog vs. Digital, Sampling Rate, Nyquist Theorem, Bit Depth, Quantization, Decibels (dB), common audio formats (WAV, MP3 - high-level structure).
Resources:
Search: "digital audio basics tutorial", "Nyquist theorem explained simply", "audio sampling and quantization".
Librosa Docs: Read the "Introduction" and "Core Concepts" sections.
Articles/Videos: Look for introductory videos on YouTube channels like Computerphile or physics channels explaining sound waves.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Python Review: If needed, use official Python tutorials or sites like Real Python.
Setup: Install Anaconda/Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Create a dedicated environment (conda create -n audio_ml python=3.9). Activate it (conda activate audio_ml).   
Install Libraries: conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyterlab (or pip install ...). Then pip install librosa sounddevice (sounddevice for playback, optional but helpful).
Find & Read: Search for "introduction to digital audio processing python".
Day 3-4: Introduction to Librosa - Loading & Basic Representation

Learn (1 hr/day):
Librosa's Purpose: Understand it's for audio analysis in Python.
librosa.load(): Deep dive into its documentation. Understand y (time series) and sr (sampling rate). Note the default sr=22050 and its implications (computational efficiency vs. frequency range). Mono conversion by default.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Dataset: Download and organize GTZAN or FMA subset. Note file paths.
Loading Script: In a Jupyter notebook or Python script: import librosa, audio_path = 'path/to/your/audio.wav', y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path). Print y.shape, sr.
Experiment: Load the same file with sr=None (native SR) vs. default sr=22050. Compare shapes and sr values. Load stereo files if available and see how mono=True (default) vs mono=False changes y.shape.
Plotting: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4)), plt.plot(y), plt.title('Raw Waveform'), plt.xlabel('Sample Index'), plt.ylabel('Amplitude'), plt.show().
Playback (Jupyter): import IPython.display as ipd, ipd.Audio(y, rate=sr). (Or use sounddevice: import sounddevice as sd, sd.play(y, sr), sd.wait()). Listen to what you loaded!
Day 5-7: Time-Domain Visualization & Basic Manipulation

Learn (1 hr/day):
Waveform Interpretation: What do peaks/valleys mean? Amplitude Envelope concept (general loudness contour).
Numpy Basics: Slicing (y[start:end]), element-wise operations (y * 2 for amplification, y * 0.5 for attenuation).
Frames: Introduce the idea that analysis is often done on short, overlapping frames of audio, not the whole file at once (precursor to STFT).
Do (2 hrs/day):
Better Visualization: import librosa.display, plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4)), librosa.display.waveshow(y, sr=sr), plt.title('Waveform via librosa.display'), plt.show(). Notice the time axis.
Explore Subsets: Plot y[:sr] (first second), y[sr*5:sr*10] (seconds 5-10).
Basic Effects: Create y_amplified = y * 1.5, y_attenuated = y * 0.5. Plot and listen.
Simple Stats: import numpy as np, print(f"Max Amp: {np.max(np.abs(y))}"), print(f"Mean Amp: {np.mean(y)}"). Note: Mean is often near zero for centered audio. RMS (Week 3) is more meaningful for energy.
Documentation Habit: Start adding comments (#) explaining why you are doing something.
Week 2: Frequency Domain Analysis & Spectrograms with Librosa

Day 8-9: Introduction to Frequency Domain & STFT

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Why Frequency?: Timbre, pitch, and many characteristics are better seen in frequency.
Fourier Transform Intuition: Decomposing a signal into its constituent sine waves (frequencies). Search "Fourier Transform visualization", "3Blue1Brown Fourier Transform".
STFT: Applying FT repeatedly on short, overlapping windows. Understand the trade-off between time and frequency resolution.
Key Parameters: n_fft (window size, determines frequency resolution), hop_length (step size between windows, determines time resolution). Read the librosa.stft documentation.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Calculate STFT: stft_result = librosa.stft(y, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512).
Examine Output: Print stft_result.shape. Notice it's complex (dtype=complex). Rows correspond to frequency bins (up to n_fft // 2 + 1), columns to time frames. Calculate expected dimensions: n_frames = 1 + len(y) // hop_length.
Day 10-12: Spectrograms & Mel Spectrograms



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              YOU'RE HERE(29/04/2025)



Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Magnitude Spectrogram: np.abs(stft_result). Represents the amplitude of each frequency at each time.
Power Spectrogram: np.abs(stft_result)**2. Represents energy.
Log-Scale (dB): Human perception of loudness is logarithmic. librosa.amplitude_to_db() converts linear amplitude/power to dB. Read its documentation.
Mel Scale: Perceptually motivated frequency scale, closer to human pitch perception (more bins for lower frequencies). Search "Mel Scale audio".
Mel Spectrogram: librosa.feature.melspectrogram. Spectrogram warped onto the Mel scale. Read its documentation. Understand parameter n_mels.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Calculate Spectrograms:
mag_spec = np.abs(stft_result)
power_spec = mag_spec**2
log_power_spec = librosa.amplitude_to_db(power_spec, ref=np.max)
Calculate Mel Spectrogram: mel_spec = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512, n_mels=128)
Check Shapes: Print shapes of all calculated spectrograms. Note mel_spec has n_mels rows.
Day 13-14: Visualizing Spectrograms & Librosa Display

Learn (1 hr/day):
librosa.display.specshow: The go-to function for visualizing spectrograms. Read its documentation carefully.
Key Parameters: data (the spectrogram), sr, hop_length, x_axis ('time'), y_axis ('linear', 'log', 'mel'). Color maps (cmap). Color bar (plt.colorbar()).
Do (2 hrs/day):
Visualize Extensively:
librosa.display.specshow(log_power_spec, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, x_axis='time', y_axis='log')
librosa.display.specshow(librosa.amplitude_to_db(mel_spec, ref=np.max), sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, x_axis='time', y_axis='mel')
Experiment: Change n_fft, hop_length, n_mels and observe the changes in the visualized spectrograms (resolution trade-offs). Try different cmap values.
Compare Genres: Load audio from 2-3 different genres (e.g., classical, metal, blues) and display their Mel spectrograms side-by-side. Note the visual differences.
Week 3: Exploring Core Audio Features with Librosa

Day 15-16: Time-Domain Features

Learn (1 hr/day):
RMS Energy: librosa.feature.rms. Frame-by-frame energy calculation, related to loudness. Read docs.
Zero-Crossing Rate: librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate. Frame-by-frame rate at which the signal crosses the zero axis. Related to "noisiness" or dominant frequency (higher for high-frequency/noisy sounds). Read docs.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Calculate: rms = librosa.feature.rms(y=y, frame_length=2048, hop_length=512)[0], zcr = librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y=y, frame_length=2048, hop_length=512)[0]. Note the [0] to get the 1D array.
Check Shapes: Print rms.shape, zcr.shape. Should match the number of frames.
Plot over Time: Use matplotlib to plot RMS and ZCR values against time frames. You might need to generate a time axis: times = librosa.times_like(rms, sr=sr, hop_length=512). Plot alongside waveshow or specshow for context.
Summary Stats (File Level): print(f"Mean RMS: {np.mean(rms)}, Std RMS: {np.std(rms)}"), print(f"Mean ZCR: {np.mean(zcr)}, Std ZCR: {np.std(zcr)}"). Calculate these for different genre examples.
Day 17-19: Frequency-Domain Features (Spectral)

Learn (1.5 hrs/day): Focus on the intuition behind each feature:
Spectral Centroid: librosa.feature.spectral_centroid. "Center of mass" of the spectrum. Brighter sounds have higher centroid. Docs.
Spectral Bandwidth: librosa.feature.spectral_bandwidth. Measures the width/spread of the spectrum around the centroid. Docs.
Spectral Contrast: librosa.feature.spectral_contrast. Measures difference between peaks and valleys in spectrum bands. Related to tonal vs. noise-like characteristics. Docs. Understand n_bands.
Spectral Rolloff: librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff. Frequency below which a certain percentage (e.g., 85%) of the total spectral energy lies. Related to skewness of the spectrum. Docs. Understand roll_percent.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Calculate: Compute each feature using librosa.feature.*(y=y, sr=sr, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512). Remember [0] for 1D features. Spectral Contrast returns multiple rows (bands).
Plot: Plot features over time (librosa.times_like).
Compare: Calculate features for different genre examples. Do the values align with intuition (e.g., higher centroid for metal than classical)?
Summary Stats (File Level): Calculate mean and standard deviation for each feature (and each band of contrast) per file. np.mean(feature, axis=1) for multi-row features like contrast.
Day 20-21: Feature Aggregation & Initial Feature Set Design

Learn (1 hr/day):
Why Aggregate?: ML models typically need fixed-size input vectors per sample (file). Frame-level features produce variable-length sequences. Aggregation (mean, std, min, max, median, skew, kurtosis) reduces dimensionality and creates a fixed summary.
Trade-offs: Aggregation loses temporal information but makes standard ML applicable.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Design Function: Write a Python function extract_features(audio_path):
Loads audio: y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, mono=True)
Calculates frame-level features: RMS, ZCR, Centroid, Bandwidth, Rolloff, Contrast (maybe 4-7 bands). Use consistent n_fft, hop_length.
Calculates summary stats: For each feature (and each band of contrast), compute np.mean, np.std, maybe np.min, np.max, scipy.stats.skew, scipy.stats.kurtosis.
Collects stats: Store results in a dictionary (e.g., {'rms_mean': ..., 'rms_std': ..., 'centroid_mean': ..., 'contrast_1_mean': ...}).
Returns the dictionary.
Test Function: Call this function on 5-10 audio files from different genres. Print the resulting dictionaries. Ensure it works reliably. Add comments!
Week 4: Advanced Features (MFCCs, Chroma) & Dataset Processing

Day 22-24: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) Deep Dive

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Revisit Mel Spectrogram: Foundation for MFCCs.
Cepstrum: "Spectrum of the spectrum". Separates source (vocal cords) from filter (vocal tract). MFCCs are a type of cepstral feature. Search "cepstral analysis audio tutorial".
Why MFCCs?: Capture timbral/textural characteristics, good for speech/music. Relatively robust to noise.
Steps (Conceptual): Framing -> Windowing -> FFT -> Mel Filterbank -> Log -> DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform - decorrelates filterbank energies).
Interpretation: Lower coefficients (~1-13) capture broad spectral shape (timbre). Higher ones capture finer details. Coefficient 0 often relates to energy (sometimes discarded).
Librosa: librosa.feature.mfcc. Read docs. Key parameter n_mfcc.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Calculate: mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512) (Commonly use 13, 20, or 40 MFCCs).
Visualize: Use librosa.display.specshow(mfccs, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, x_axis='time'). Notice rows are coefficients, columns are frames.
Summary Stats: Calculate mean and std dev for each MFCC coefficient across frames per file. E.g., mfcc_mean = np.mean(mfccs, axis=1), mfcc_std = np.std(mfccs, axis=1).
Integrate: Add aggregated MFCC stats (e.g., mean and std for MFCCs 1-13) to your extract_features function. You'll add ~26 new features.
Day 25-26: Chroma Features

Learn (1 hr/day):
Pitch Classes: The 12 notes in Western music (C, C#, ..., B). Chroma features project the entire spectrum onto these 12 bins.
Purpose: Capture harmonic content, useful for chord/key identification, genre classification (where harmony matters).
Librosa Functions:
librosa.feature.chroma_stft: Based on STFT. Docs.
librosa.feature.chroma_cqt: Based on Constant-Q Transform (better frequency resolution for lower frequencies). Docs. Often better for music.
librosa.feature.chroma_cens: Energy normalized, smoothed version. Robust to dynamics/timbre changes. Docs.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Calculate: Compute chroma features using chroma_stft, chroma_cqt, chroma_cens. E.g., chroma = librosa.feature.chroma_cqt(y=y, sr=sr, hop_length=512).
Visualize: librosa.display.specshow(chroma, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, y_axis='chroma', x_axis='time'). Note the 12 rows.
Compare: Visually compare the outputs of the different chroma functions on the same audio file. chroma_cqt or chroma_cens are often preferred for music.
Summary Stats: Calculate mean and std dev for each of the 12 chroma bins per file.
Integrate: Add aggregated chroma stats (e.g., mean and std for each of the 12 bins from chroma_cqt) to your extract_features function. Adds ~24 features.
Day 27-28: Full Dataset Feature Extraction & Saving

Learn (1 hr/day):
Batch Processing Issues: Files might be corrupt, too short, silent. Need error handling.
Efficiency: This step can take hours.
Storage: Pandas DataFrames are ideal. Saving to CSV (.to_csv()) is human-readable, Pickle (.to_pickle()) is faster for loading/saving Python objects but less portable.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Finalize Feature Set: Review all features added to your function. Decide on the final set (e.g., RMS mean/std, ZCR mean/std, Centroid mean/std, Bandwidth mean/std, Rolloff mean/std, Contrast (6 bands) mean/std, MFCCs (1-13) mean/std, Chroma_CQT (12 bins) mean/std). Count the total number of features.
Prepare File List: Get a list of all audio file paths and their corresponding genre labels. Store this maybe in a list of tuples [(path1, label1), (path2, label2), ...].
Run Extraction Loop:
Python

import pandas as pd
from tqdm import tqdm # Progress bar
import os

all_features = []
all_labels = []
file_list = [...] # Your list of (path, label)

for file_path, label in tqdm(file_list):
    try:
        features = extract_features(file_path) # Your function
        # Add filename/label if needed
        features['filename'] = os.path.basename(file_path)
        features['label'] = label
        all_features.append(features)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")
        # Optionally log errors to a file

feature_df = pd.DataFrame(all_features)
Save DataFrame: feature_df.to_csv('audio_features.csv', index=False), or feature_df.to_pickle('audio_features.pkl').
Patience: Let it run!
Month 2: Machine Learning Modeling, Evaluation & Refinement

Week 5: Data Prep, ML Fundamentals Review & Baseline Models

Day 29-30: Data Loading, Cleaning & EDA

Learn (1 hr/day):
Reloading: pd.read_csv() or pd.read_pickle().
Post-Extraction Check: Always re-check for NaNs/Infs introduced during calculation or missed by try-except. df.isnull().sum().sum().
EDA on Features: Understand distributions, relationships between features, and relationships between features and the target (genre).
Tools: Pandas .info(), .describe(). Seaborn heatmap() for correlations, boxplot() or violinplot() for feature distribution per genre. Matplotlib hist() for individual feature distributions.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Load: df = pd.read_csv('audio_features.csv') (or pickle).
Inspect: df.info(), df.describe(), print(df.isnull().sum()). Handle NaNs if any (e.g., df.dropna(inplace=True) or imputation if appropriate, though drop is often simpler initially).
Correlation: import seaborn as sns, corr_matrix = df.drop(['filename', 'label'], axis=1).corr(), plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10)), sns.heatmap(corr_matrix), plt.show(). Look for highly correlated features (potential redundancy).
Distributions: sns.boxplot(data=df, x='label', y='rms_mean'), plt.show(). Do this for several key features (e.g., centroid_mean, a couple of MFCC means, a chroma mean). See which features show clear separation between genres.
Class Balance: df['label'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar'), plt.show(). Check if genres are roughly equally represented. Imbalance might require techniques later (e.g., class weighting, stratified sampling).
Day 31-32: Feature Scaling & Train/Test Split

Learn (1 hr/day):
Why Scale?: Many ML algorithms (SVM, KNN, NNs, Logistic Regression with regularization) assume or perform better when features are on a similar scale.
Scalers: StandardScaler (zero mean, unit variance) - common default. MinMaxScaler (scales to [0, 1]) - useful if algorithm requires non-negative inputs. Read Scikit-learn's Preprocessing guide.
Fit on Train ONLY: Crucial! Fit the scaler (.fit()) only on the training data, then use it to transform (.transform()) both training and testing data to avoid data leakage.
Train/Test Split: train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. Importance of stratify=y for classification to maintain class proportions in both sets. Read docs.   
Do (2 hrs/day):
Separate X/y: X = df.drop(['filename', 'label'], axis=1), y = df['label'].
Split: from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y) (Use a fixed random_state for reproducibility).
Scale:
Python

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
# Optional: Convert back to DataFrame for inspection
# X_train_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_train_scaled, columns=X_train.columns)
# X_test_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_test_scaled, columns=X_test.columns)
Verify: Check shapes (.shape) of all resulting arrays/DataFrames. Check X_train_scaled.mean(axis=0) (should be near 0) and X_train_scaled.std(axis=0) (should be near 1).
Day 33-35: ML Classification Review & Baseline Modeling

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Review Models: Logistic Regression (docs), K-Nearest Neighbors (docs), Support Vector Machines (docs). Understand basic assumptions, pros/cons for this task.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy (docs), Precision, Recall, F1-score (understand macro, micro, weighted averages - read about classification_report docs), Confusion Matrix (docs). Focus on what each tells you, especially in multi-class settings.   
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Import: from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, from sklearn.svm import SVC, from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay.
Train & Predict (Example for LogReg):
Python

log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000) # Increase max_iter if it doesn't converge
log_reg.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred_log_reg = log_reg.predict(X_test_scaled)
Evaluate (Example for LogReg):
Python

print("Logistic Regression Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_log_reg))
print("\nLogistic Regression Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred_log_reg))
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, y_pred_log_reg, xticks_rotation='vertical')
plt.title('Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
Repeat: Do this for KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5) (try a few n_neighbors like 3, 7, 11) and SVC(kernel='linear'), SVC(kernel='rbf').
Record Results: Note down the accuracy and key F1-scores (e.g., weighted avg) for each model. This is your performance baseline.
Week 6: Tree-Based Models, Ensembles & Cross-Validation

Day 36-37: Decision Trees & Random Forests

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Decision Trees: How they make splits (Gini impurity, entropy). Prone to overfitting. Visualize a simple tree if possible (sklearn.tree.plot_tree). Docs.
Random Forests: Ensemble of multiple decision trees. Uses bagging (bootstrap sampling) and feature randomness at each split to reduce variance/overfitting. Key hyperparameters: n_estimators (number of trees), max_depth (tree depth), min_samples_split. Docs.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Import: from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier.
Train & Evaluate DT: dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42), train, predict, evaluate. Observe if training accuracy is much higher than test accuracy (sign of overfitting). Try limiting max_depth=10.   
Train & Evaluate RF: rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1) (n_jobs=-1 uses all CPU cores). Train, predict, evaluate. Compare results to baselines and the single decision tree.
Feature Importances (RF): importances = rf.feature_importances_, feature_names = X_train.columns, forest_importances = pd.Series(importances, index=feature_names).sort_values(ascending=False), plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)), forest_importances[:20].plot(kind='bar'), plt.title('Top 20 Feature Importances (Random Forest)'), plt.show(). See which features the model relies on most.
Day 38-39: Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Boosting Concept: Building models sequentially, where each new model tries to correct the errors of the previous ones.
Gradient Boosting: A specific type of boosting using gradient descent. Can be very powerful but potentially slower to train and more sensitive to hyperparameters. Key params: n_estimators, learning_rate (shrinks contribution of each tree), max_depth. Docs.
Mention Alternatives: Briefly read about XGBoost (https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/) and LightGBM (https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/) - often faster/more performant implementations (optional installation/use).
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Import: from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier.
Train & Evaluate GBM: gbm = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42). Train, predict, evaluate. Compare results. Note training time compared to RF. Try slightly different learning_rate or max_depth values if time permits.
Day 40-42: Cross-Validation Deep Dive

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
Problem with Single Split: Test set performance might be overly optimistic/pessimistic depending on the specific split.
K-Fold CV: Splitting the training data into K folds. Train on K-1 folds, validate on the held-out fold. Repeat K times. Average the validation scores for a more robust performance estimate.
Stratified K-Fold: Ensures class proportions are maintained in each fold, essential for classification. Docs.
Scikit-learn Utilities: cross_val_score (quick score check), cross_validate (more detailed metrics). Read CV documentation. Emphasize using CV only on the training set (X_train_scaled, y_train) for model selection/hyperparameter tuning. The test set (X_test_scaled, y_test) is held out until the very end.
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Import: from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score.
Setup CV: cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42).
Run CV (Example for RF):
Python

rf_cv = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)
scores = cross_val_score(rf_cv, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy')
print(f"Random Forest CV Accuracy Scores: {scores}")
print(f"Random Forest CV Mean Accuracy: {np.mean(scores):.4f} (+/- {np.std(scores):.4f})")
Repeat: Perform CV for 1-2 other promising models (e.g., SVM with RBF kernel, Logistic Regression).
Analyze: Compare the mean CV scores to the single test set scores obtained earlier. Note the standard deviation across folds - higher std indicates less stable performance.
Week 7: Neural Networks & Hyperparameter Optimization

Day 43-45: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for Classification

Learn (1.5 hrs/day):
MLP Basics: Review layers (input, hidden, output), neurons, weights, biases. Activation functions (ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for multi-class output layer). Loss function (Cross-Entropy for classification). Optimizer (Adam is common). Backpropagation (high-level concept of how weights are updated).
Scikit-learn's MLPClassifier: Simple interface for standard MLPs. Key parameters: hidden_layer_sizes (tuple defining architecture, e.g., (64,) or (128, 64)), activation, solver, alpha (L2 regularization), learning_rate_init, max_iter, early_stopping. Read docs.   
Do (1.5 hrs/day):
Import: from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier.
Train & Evaluate MLP:
Python

mlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100,), activation='relu', solver='adam',
                    alpha=0.0001, learning_rate_init=0.001, max_iter=500, # Increase max_iter if needed
                    random_state=42, early_stopping=True, validation_fraction=0.1)
mlp.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred_mlp = mlp.predict(X_test_scaled)
print("MLP Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_mlp))
print("\nMLP Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred_mlp))
# Optional: Plot loss curve
# plt.plot(mlp.loss_curve_)
# plt.title("MLP Loss Curve")
# plt.show()
Experiment: Try different hidden_layer_sizes (e.g., (64, 32)), maybe activation='tanh'. Observe performance changes and convergence (if verbose=True). Compare to other models.
Day 46-49: Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearch & RandomizedSearch

Learn (1 hr/day):
Need for Tuning: Most models have hyperparameters that significantly affect performance; defaults aren't always optimal.
GridSearchCV: Exhaustively tries all combinations of parameters specified in a grid. Can be very slow if the grid is large. Docs.
RandomizedSearchCV: Samples a fixed number of parameter combinations from specified distributions. Often finds good parameters much faster than GridSearchCV, especially with many parameters. Docs.
Process: Define parameter grid/distribution -> Choose model -> Instantiate SearchCV object (passing model, params, cv, scoring method) -> Fit SearchCV on training data (X_train_scaled, y_train) -> Examine best_params_, best_score_.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Import: from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.
Select Model(s): Choose 1 or 2 best performers from previous steps (e.g., RandomForest, SVM, maybe MLP if promising).
Define Parameter Grid/Distribution (Example for RandomForest):
Python

param_dist_rf = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
    # 'bootstrap': [True, False] # If you want to try that
}
rf_tune = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)
# Using RandomizedSearchCV (faster)
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(rf_tune, param_distributions=param_dist_rf,
                                   n_iter=20, # Number of parameter settings that are sampled
                                   cv=cv, # Use the StratifiedKFold from before
                                   scoring='accuracy', random_state=42, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1)
Run Search: random_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train) (This can take time!)
Analyze Results:
Python

print("Best Parameters found by RandomizedSearch:", random_search.best_params_)
print("Best CV Accuracy found by RandomizedSearch:", random_search.best_score_)
# You can access the best model via: best_rf = random_search.best_estimator_
Optional: Repeat for another model (e.g., SVC with C and gamma parameters, or MLP with hidden_layer_sizes, alpha, learning_rate_init).
Week 8: Final Evaluation, Documentation & Wrap-up

Day 50-51: Training Final Model(s) & Final Evaluation

Learn (0.5 hrs/day): The purpose of the hold-out test set: provide an unbiased estimate of the final model's performance on unseen data. Train the best model (using best_params_) on the entire training set.
Do (2.5 hrs/day):
Instantiate Final Model: Use the best_params_ found via GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.
Python

# Example using results from RF tuning
final_model = RandomForestClassifier(**random_search.best_params_, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)
# Or if you tuned SVC:
# final_model = SVC(**grid_search_svc.best_params_, probability=True) # probability=True if needed later
Train on Full Training Set: final_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
Predict on Test Set: y_pred_final = final_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
Final Evaluation:
Python

print("--- Final Model Evaluation on Test Set ---")
print("Final Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_final))
print("\nFinal Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred_final))
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, y_pred_final, xticks_rotation='vertical')
plt.title('Final Model Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
Record: This is your definitive project result. Compare it to the baseline and CV scores.
Day 52-54: Advanced Error Analysis & Interpretation

Learn (1 hr/day):
Beyond Metrics: Look inside the confusion matrix. Which specific genres are confused most often? Why might that be (similar instrumentation, tempo, etc.)?
Feature Importance Revisited: If the final model was tree-based, re-examine feature_importances_. Do they make sense?
Model Interpretability: Briefly explore concepts like SHAP or LIME (optional, requires extra libraries/learning) for understanding why a specific prediction was made. Search "shap python tutorial", "lime machine learning".
Do (2 hrs/day):
Analyze Confusion Matrix: Identify the cells with high off-diagonal values. List the most common confusion pairs (e.g., "Rock often confused with Metal").
Feature Importances (if applicable): Plot final_model.feature_importances_. Compare with earlier RF importances.
Qualitative Analysis (Optional but insightful):
Find indices of some misclassified samples: misclassified_idx = np.where(y_test != y_pred_final)[0]
Get the corresponding original file paths/data.
Listen to a few misclassified audio samples. Do they sound ambiguous?
Look at the features for these misclassified samples in the original DataFrame (df.iloc[X_test.index[misclassified_idx]]). Do their features look more like the predicted genre or the true genre?
Day 55-57: Code Cleaning, Documentation & Report Writing

Learn (1 hr/day):
Code Quality: Organizing code into functions (like extract_features, train_model, evaluate_model). Adding clear comments and docstrings. PEP 8 style guide. Aim for reproducibility.
README.md: Essential for any project. Include: Project Title, Goal, Dataset Info, Setup Instructions (environment, libraries), How to Run (feature extraction, training, evaluation), Results Summary.
Report Structure: Introduction (Problem, Goal), Data (Source, Features Extracted), Methods (Preprocessing, Models Used, Tuning, Evaluation Metrics), Results (Baseline, CV, Final Model Performance, Error Analysis), Discussion/Conclusion (Interpretation, Limitations), Future Work.
Do (2 hrs/day):
Refactor Code: Clean up Jupyter notebooks or scripts. Put reusable code into functions. Ensure clarity.
Write README: Create a comprehensive README.md file in your project directory.
Write Report: Draft the technical report documenting your process, decisions, and findings. Use plots generated throughout the project.
Day 58-60: Final Review, Presentation Prep & Reflection

Learn (0.5 hrs/day): Tips for presenting ML results: focus on the goal, data, key findings (visualizations!), and limitations/next steps. Keep it concise.
Do (2.5 hrs/day):
Review: Read through all your code, README, and report. Check for errors, clarity, consistency. Could someone else understand and run your project?
Presentation Prep: Create a short slide deck or outline key talking points summarizing the project. Include key visuals (spectrogram example, feature importance, confusion matrix).
Reflect: What was hardest? What's still unclear? What are 3 things you'd do differently next time? What are concrete next steps (e.g., try convolutional neural networks directly on spectrograms, use more data, engineer different features, deploy the model)?
Buffer: Use any remaining time to catch up or polish documentation/code.
